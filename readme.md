# SSSDB

Simple Semantic Search Database

# Motivation

SSSDB aims to be a useful in-memory database for vector search. Eventually you will outscale in-memory search, but not for a while, so might as well start simple. You can even use an interface that's identical to larger scale DB services, to make the code changes easy.

# Features

- Dense embedding and sparse embedding support
- Metadata filtering
- Saving / loading db
